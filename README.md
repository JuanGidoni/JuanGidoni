> [!NOTE]
> 🧙 I’m a Frontend Tech Lead Engineer with more than five years of experience building scalable and high-performance applications using React. My work focuses on designing and leading modern frontend architectures such as Hexagonal, Domain-Driven, Clean Architecture and Feature-Sliced, ensuring codebases remain clear, maintainable and ready to grow.
>
> Over time, I’ve moved from developing single-page applications to leading the architecture and delivery of several digital banking products. I work closely with cross-functional teams to align technical direction with business goals, making sure that quality and consistency are present in every release.
>
> I care deeply about technical leadership and team development. Mentoring engineers, defining standards, and creating a collaborative environment are key parts of how I help teams build software that scales and lasts.
